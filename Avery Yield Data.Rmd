title: "Avery Yield Data"
output: html_notebook
---

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
source("Setup.R")
```

```{r}
#load avery yield data
yield_benefit_model <- read_csv('Data-Files/yield-benefit-model-data.csv')
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.


```{r}
#oklahoma filter 
oklahoma_yield <- yield_benefit_model %>% 
  filter(state_ansi == 40)
oklahoma_yield_wheat <- oklahoma_yield %>% 
  filter(str_detect(commodity_desc, "WHEAT"))
```


```{r}
ggplot(oklahoma_yield_wheat, aes(x = mean_tmax, y = irr)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_smooth()+
  theme_minimal()         
```

```{r}
ggplot(oklahoma_yield_wheat, aes(x = mean_tmax, y = rainfed)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_smooth()+
  theme_minimal()
